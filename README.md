English to German file translator (in local :) 

Make sure the file to be translated is named <toTranslate.txt> and it is placed in the same folder as the file <myTranslator.py> otherwise you wouldn't be able to run the script properly . 

However make sure that the content of the file to be translated is in english .

Inside your terminal move to the location of the folder containing the myTranslator.py and run the following  command <python3 myTranslator.py>
The corresponding translated file should appear as <translated.txt>
